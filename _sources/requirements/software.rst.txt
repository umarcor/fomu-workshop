Required Software
#################

.. NOTE::
   If youâ€™re taking this workshop as a class, the toolchains are provided
   on the USB disk.

Fomu requires specialized software. This software is provided for GNU/Linux, macOS,
and Windows, via `Fomu Toolchain <https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-toolchain/releases/latest>`__.
Debian packages are also `available for Raspberry Pi <https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-raspbian-packages>`__.

To install the software, extract it somewhere on your computer, then
open up a terminal window and add that directory to your ``PATH``:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: GNU/Linux or MacOS X

      .. session:: shell-session

         $ export PATH=[path-to-toolchain]/bin:$PATH

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      If you use PowerShell as your terminal;

      .. session:: ps1con

         PS> $ENV:PATH = "[path-to-toolchain]\bin;" + $ENV:PATH

      If you use ``cmd.exe`` as your terminal;

      .. session:: doscon

         C:\> PATH=[path-to-toolchain]\bin;%PATH%

Examples in :ref:`HDLs:VHDL` and :ref:`HDLs:mixed` use `ghdl-yosys-plugin <https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin>`_,
which looks for standard libraries in the path used when GHDL was configured/built.
Therefore, when the toolchain is extracted to an arbitrary location, ``GHDL_PREFIX``
needs to be set:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: GNU/Linux or MacOS X

      .. session:: shell-session

         $ export GHDL_PREFIX=[path-to-toolchain]/lib/ghdl

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      If you use PowerShell as your terminal;

      .. session:: ps1con

         PS> $ENV:GHDL_PREFIX = "[path-to-toolchain]\lib\ghdl"

      If you use ``cmd.exe`` as your terminal;

      .. session:: doscon

         C:\> GHDL_PREFIX=[path-to-toolchain]\lib\ghdl

To confirm installation, run the ``yosys`` command and confirm you get
the following output;

.. code-block:: shell-session
   :emphasize-lines: 23

   $ yosys
